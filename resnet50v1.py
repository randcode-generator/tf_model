  First, this function creates scopes for the ResNet in the form of

  Second, this function allows the user to explicitly control the ResNet
  output_stride, which is the ratio of the input to output spatial resolution.
  This is useful for dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or
  object detection.

  Most ResNets consist of 4 ResNet blocks and subsample the activations by a
  factor of 2 when transitioning between consecutive ResNet blocks. This results
  to a nominal ResNet output_stride equal to 8. If we set the output_stride to
  half the nominal network stride (e.g., output_stride=4), then we compute
  responses twice.

  Control of the output feature density is implemented by atrous convolution.

      ratio of input to output spatial resolution, which needs to be equal to
      the product of unit strides from the start up to some level of the ResNet.
      For example, if the ResNet employs units with strides 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1,

  """Generator for v1 ResNet models.

  This function generates a family of ResNet v1 models. See the resnet_v1_*()
  methods for specific model instantiations, obtained by selecting different
  block instantiations that produce ResNets of various depths.

  Training for image classification on Imagenet is usually done with [224, 224]
  inputs, resulting in [7, 7] feature maps at the output of the last ResNet
  block for the ResNets defined in [1] that have nominal stride equal to 32.
  However, for dense prediction tasks we advise that one uses inputs with
  spatial dimensions that are multiples of 32 plus 1, e.g., [321, 321]. In
  this case the feature maps at the ResNet output will have spatial shape
  [(height - 1) / output_stride + 1, (width - 1) / output_stride + 1]
  and corners exactly aligned with the input image corners, which greatly
  facilitates alignment of the features to the image. Using as input [225, 225]
  images results in [8, 8] feature maps at the output of the last ResNet block.

  For dense prediction tasks, the ResNet needs to run in fully-convolutional
  (FCN) mode and global_pool needs to be set to False. The ResNets in [1, 2] all
  have nominal stride equal to 32 and a good choice in FCN mode is to use
  output_stride=16 in order to increase the density of the computed features at
  small computational and memory overhead, cf. http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915.

  Args:
    inputs: A tensor of size [batch, height_in, width_in, channels].
    blocks: A list of length equal to the number of ResNet blocks. Each element
      is a resnet_utils.Block object describing the units in the block.
    num_classes: Number of predicted classes for classification tasks.
      If 0 or None, we return the features before the logit layer.
    is_training: whether batch_norm layers are in training mode. If this is set
      to None, the callers can specify slim.batch_norm's is_training parameter
      from an outer slim.arg_scope.
    global_pool: If True, we perform global average pooling before computing the
      logits. Set to True for image classification, False for dense prediction.
    output_stride: If None, then the output will be computed at the nominal
      network stride. If output_stride is not None, it specifies the requested
      ratio of input to output spatial resolution.
    include_root_block: If True, include the initial convolution followed by
      max-pooling, if False excludes it.
    spatial_squeeze: if True, logits is of shape [B, C], if false logits is
        of shape [B, 1, 1, C], where B is batch_size and C is number of classes.
        To use this parameter, the input images must be smaller than 300x300
        pixels, in which case the output logit layer does not contain spatial
        information and can be removed.
    store_non_strided_activations: If True, we compute non-strided (undecimated)
      activations at the last unit of each block and store them in the
      `outputs_collections` before subsampling them. This gives us access to
      higher resolution intermediate activations which are useful in some
      dense prediction problems but increases 4x the computation and memory cost
      at the last unit of each block.
    reuse: whether or not the network and its variables should be reused. To be
      able to reuse 'scope' must be given.
    scope: Optional variable_scope.

  Returns:
    net: A rank-4 tensor of size [batch, height_out, width_out, channels_out].
      If global_pool is False, then height_out and width_out are reduced by a

      then net is the output of the last ResNet block, potentially after global
      average pooling. If num_classes a non-zero integer, net contains the
      pre-softmax activations.
